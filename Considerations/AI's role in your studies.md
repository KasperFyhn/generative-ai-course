# AI's role in your studies

To re-use an often used metaphor: compare GAI to a calculator.

It is a powerful tool and aid in an academic setting. But as a student, one must also be careful about one's learning and own knowledge and not become over-reliant on such tools.


### Good Example
A student uses a generative AI tool to generate ideas for a debate on a controversial topic. The student inputs a neutral prompt such as "Discuss the pros and cons of nuclear energy." The AI generates a balanced list of points, which the student uses as a starting point for their own research.

In this case, the student is using the AI tool as a means to broaden their perspective and enhance their critical thinking skills.

### Bad Example
A student uses a generative AI tool to complete their entire assignment, inputting the assignment question and submitting the generated text as their own work without any additional thought or effort.

This is a clear example of a situation where a student misuses the tool and will learn close to nothing.

## Why it is relevant
While generative AI tools can be incredibly helpful in the learning process, they must be used appropriately. Using them to generate entire assignments not only undermines the educational process, but can also lead to academic penalties if discovered. It is important to use these tools as aids to enhance learning, not as shortcuts to avoid it.

Remember, the goal of using generative AI tools should be to enhance your learning and productivity, not to replace your own efforts entirely. 

## Practical Exercises
1. Reflect on how you can use generative AI tools appropriately in your studies while retaining all integrity behind your work. Write down some guidelines for yourself.
