# Limitations

GAI has its limitations. It does not always know that itself.

1. **Accuracy and Reliability**: GAI may not always provide accurate or reliable information. It can misunderstand context or nuances, leading to errors or misconceptions. This is crucial for academic work where accuracy is paramount.

1. **Creativity Limitations**: While GAI can generate creative content, it lacks true originality and is bound by the patterns in its training data. For fields requiring novel ideas or perspectives, this can be a significant limitation.

1. **Understanding Context and Depth**: GAI struggles with deep understanding and contextual nuances, which can be critical in complex academic subjects or discussions.
