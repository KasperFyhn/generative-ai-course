# Using generative AI as a student

The contents of this project are meant to serve as the basis for materials for a self-enrollment course on using generative AI as a (university) student.

It is aimed at students at all levels and with different levels of proficiency in using generative AI. Whether you are a novice or feel like an expert, the modules will help you discover ways to enchance your studies, refine your prompting skills and techniques, and guide you towards a healthy and responsible use of GAI.

You may find that much of the content is obvious as you become more adept at using GAI. It is to help you, and everyone else, avoid common pitfalls and give a nudge towards effective use of GAI.

The skills and use-cases are far from exhaustive. They are there to serve as initial guidance and inspiration. You know best how GAI is best integrated, if at all, in your workflow as a student.
