# Using generative AI as a student

The contents of this project are meant to serve as the basis for materials on using generative AI as a (university) student. Specifically, the course is about text generative AI or chatbots backed by large language models, like ChatGPT and Bard.

It is aimed at students at all levels and with different educational backgrounds. Whether a novice or an expert when it comes to using generative AI, the modules can help students discover ways to enchance their studies, refine their prompting skills and techniques, and guide them towards a healthy and responsible use of GAI.

The contents are not theory-heavy (and should not be), but should serve as practical guides and inspiration for integrating AI in your studies in a good way.

Students can go through the contents in a self-enrollment course, or instructors can pick and choose from the modules and integrate them in teaching.

The contents are created as short learning modules with a hands-on approach and are divided into three categories:
1. **Use cases**: practical use cases - examples of _what_ you can do with GAI.
1. **Skills**: refinement of prompt engineering skills  - _how_ you can do it.
1. **Considerations**: concerns and considerations that are relevant for most students to be aware of.

The _About_ document contains details on how and why the materials have been made the way they are.

## Where should I start?
It depends on your experience with GAI. Many of the modules are relevant to most students, if not for learning about something new, then for consolidating or testing your knowledge.

### I am new to this or I have only used GAI a bit in other contexts
If you are completely new to generative AI or have only used it a bit outside of your studies, good starting points are:

- Use cases: [Grasping new concepts](/Use%20cases/Grasping%20new%20concepts.md) and [Get feedback](/Use%20cases/Get%20feedback.md)
- Skills: [Clarity and specificity](/Skills/Clarity%20and%20specificity.md) and [Contextual information](/Skills/Contextual%20information.md)
- Considerations: [What is a language model?](/Considerations/What%20is%20a%20language%20model?.md) and [AI's role in your studies](/Considerations/AI's%20role%20in%20your%20studies.md)

### I have used GAI in my studies and/or for many other things
Maybe you can use these modules for testing and refining your skills, gain inspiration for other use cases or broaden your perspective on AI's place in the world.

For instance, take a look at titles of modules in [Skills](/Skills/). Do the aspects of prompting sound familiar to you? Test your skills or learn something new.

### I am quite adept at using GAI already
In that case, maybe there is not much for you to learn here, but others might be able to draw on your experience.
