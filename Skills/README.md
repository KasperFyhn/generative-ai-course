# Prompting skills

A bad prompt gives a bad response.

These modules will introduce you to making effective pre-prompts to guide the GAI, make follow-up prompts and refine your prompts to get a response that suits your needs.

The modules present why a specific aspect of prompting is important, followed by good and bad examples, guiding points and practical exercises.
