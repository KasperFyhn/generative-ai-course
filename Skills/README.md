# Prompting skills

A bad prompt gives a bad response.

These modules will introduce you to making effective pre-prompts to guide the GAI, make follow-up prompts and refine your prompts to get a response that suits your needs.

To evaluate a reponse, consider these aspects:
- Relevance
- Accuracy
- Coherence
- Style

Clear, concise and specific.

A **topic** provides a clear direction for generating text.
